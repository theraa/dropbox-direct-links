# dropbox-direct-links
macOS workflow, that turns your Dropbox links into the direct ones

1. Double click on the script file to install it. 
2. After copying your Dropbox link to the clipboard, use the custom shortcut instead of ⌘V to paste it. I use ⌘⌥V as it’s not used by any apps (e.g. ⇧⌘V wouldn't work in Chrome).

* Sometimes it is required to call the script from the menufor the first time, before it starts to be recognized by the keyboard.
